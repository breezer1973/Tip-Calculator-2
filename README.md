Pre-work Tip Calculator for Codepath
This application is an exercise to complete the application to Codepath's iOS for Designers bootcamp. I would note that there were some slight changes in the xcode UI that took a few minutes to get past, but nothing major.

Time: I spent around 1.5 hours on this exercise

What does the app can do?

 Required: The user can calculate the tip, using different percentages

Optional: I was on vacation, so I didn't really get a chance to try anything optional, but I certainly will going forward.

What did I miss?

I had issues throughout where the simulator would crash - I started over several times.
